    "### Theoretical Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?**  \n",
    "- Ans: Compiled languages (like C, C++): Code is translated into machine code before execution by a compiler. It's faster but needs compilation every time you change the code.\n",
    "- Interpreted languages (like Python, JavaScript): Code is executed line by line by an interpreter during runtime. It's slower but easier to test and debug quickly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**2. What is exception handling in Python?**\n",
    "- Ans: Exception handling in Python is a way to manage errors using ```try```, ```except```, ```else```, and ```finally``` blocks to prevent program crashes and handle problems gracefully.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?**\n",
    "- Ans: The ```finally``` block is used to run code no matter what — whether an exception occurs or not. It's often used for cleanup actions like closing files or releasing resources.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**4.  What is logging in Python?**\n",
    "- Ans: Logging in Python is a way to track events that happen when your code runs. It helps in debugging and monitoring by recording messages like errors, warnings, or info using the built-in ```logging``` module.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**5.  What is the significance of the ```__del__``` method in Python?**\n",
    "- Ans: The ```__del__``` method in Python is a destructor. It’s called automatically when an object is about to be destroyed, typically used to clean up resources like closing files or network connections.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?**\n",
    "- Ans: ```import module``` -> Imports the whole module. You access functions like: ```module.function()```\n",
    "- ```from module import function``` -> Imports specific items directly. You can use: ```function()``` without the module prefix.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?**\n",
    "- Ans: You can handle multiple exceptions using:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "      try:\n",
    "        except (TypeError, ValueError) as e:\n",
    "        # handle both exceptions\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "Or use multiple except blocks:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        except TypeError:\n",
    "        # handle TypeError\n",
    "        except ValueError:\n",
    "        # handle ValueError\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?**\n",
    "- Ans: The with statement is used to open files safely. It automatically closes the file after the block, even if an error occurs, so you don’t need to call ```close()``` manually.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "        with open(\"file.txt\", \"r\") as f:\n",
    "        data = f.read()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?**\n",
    "- Ans: Multithreading: Multiple threads run in the same process, sharing memory. Good for I/O-bound tasks. Multiprocessing: Multiple processes run independently with separate memory. Better for CPU-bound tasks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?**\n",
    "- Ans: In short, advantages of using logging: Tracks errors and events for debugging, monitors program flow in real-time or later, saves logs to files for analysis, more flexible than ```print()``` (supports levels like info, warning, error), helps in maintaining and troubleshooting production code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**11. What is memory management in Python?**\n",
    "- Ans: Memory management in Python involves automatically handling memory allocation and deallocation. Python uses:\n",
    "- Automatic garbage collection to remove unused objects.\n",
    "- Reference counting to track object references and free memory when it's no longer needed.\n",
    "- This reduces the need for manual memory management, making development easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?**\n",
    "- Ans: In short, the basic steps in exception handling in Python:\n",
    "- try block: Place code that may raise an exception.\n",
    "- except block: Catch and handle specific exceptions.\n",
    "- else block (optional): Execute if no exception occurs.\n",
    "- finally block (optional): Always execute, used for cleanup.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**13. Why is memory management important in Python?**\n",
    "- Ans: Memory management is important in Python because it:\n",
    "- Optimizes resource usage preventing memory leaks.\n",
    "- Ensures that unused memory is automatically freed, improving performance.\n",
    "- Helps avoid crashes and slowdowns in large programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?**\n",
    "- Ans: ```try```: Contains code that may raise an exception.\n",
    "- ```except```: Catches and handles the exception if it occurs, preventing the program from crashing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?**\n",
    "- Ans: Python’s garbage collection uses reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector:\n",
    "- Reference counting: Each object has a counter that tracks how many references point to it. When the count reaches zero, the object is automatically deleted.\n",
    "- Cyclic garbage collector: Detects and removes reference cycles (objects referring to each other) that the reference count can't handle.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?**\n",
    "- Ans: The ```else``` block in exception handling runs only if no exception occurs in the ```try``` block. It allows you to execute code that should only run when the try block is successful, without errors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**17.  What are the common logging levels in Python?**\n",
    "- Ans: In short, the common logging levels in Python are:\n",
    "- DEBUG: Detailed information, useful for diagnosing problems.\n",
    "- INFO: General information about program execution.\n",
    "- WARNING: Indicates something unexpected, but the program continues running.\n",
    "- ERROR: Indicates a problem that prevents part of the program from working.\n",
    "- CRITICAL: A very serious error that may cause the program to crash.\n",
    "These levels help prioritize the importance of logged messages.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?**\n",
    "- Ans: ```os.fork()```: Creates a child process by duplicating the current process. It’s available only on Unix-like systems (Linux/macOS) and can lead to issues with memory sharing.  \n",
    "- ```multiprocessing```: A higher-level Python module that provides cross-platform support for creating processes, including automatic memory management and process synchronization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?**\n",
    "- Ans: Closing a file in Python is important because:\n",
    "- It frees up system resources like memory and file handles.\n",
    "- Ensures that any unsaved data is properly written to the file.\n",
    "- Prevents potential file corruption or data loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "**20.  What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?**\n",
    "- Ans: ```file.read()```: Reads the entire file as a single string.\n",
    "- ```file.readline()```: Reads one line at a time from the file.\n",
    "Use ```read()``` for the whole file and ```readline()``` for processing file line by line.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**21. What is the logging module in Python used for?**\n",
    "- Ans: The `logging` module in Python is used to:\n",
    "- Track and record events, errors, and other messages during program execution.\n",
    "- Provide different logging levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) to control the output's verbosity.\n",
    "- Write logs to files, console, or other destinations for debugging, monitoring, and analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?**\n",
    "- Ans: The `os` module in Python is used for interacting with the operating system and performing file handling tasks such as:\n",
    "- Creating, deleting, and renaming files (`os.remove()`, `os.rename()`)\n",
    "- Navigating directories (`os.chdir()`, `os.listdir()`)\n",
    "- Checking file status (`os.path.exists()`, `os.path.isdir()`)  \n",
    "\n",
    "**23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?**\n",
    "- Ans: Challenges with memory management in Python include:\n",
    "1. Memory leaks: Objects that are no longer needed but still referenced, preventing garbage collection.\n",
    "2. Circular references: When objects refer to each other, making it hard for the garbage collector to free them.\n",
    "3. Overhead: Python’s automatic memory management can add performance overhead, especially in large-scale applications.\n",
    "(Python handles most memory management automatically, but these issues can still arise in complex programs.)  \n",
    "\n",
    "**24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?**\n",
    "- Ans: We can raise an exception manually in Python using the `raise` keyword.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "    raise Exception(\"This is an error message\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?**\n",
    "- Ans: Multithreading is important in certain applications because:\n",
    "- Improves performance for I/O-bound tasks by allowing multiple operations to run concurrently (e.g., file handling, network requests).\n",
    "- Increases responsiveness in applications with user interfaces by keeping the main thread free.\n",
    "- Efficiently utilizes CPU resources for tasks that require waiting or idle time. \n",
    "(It’s particularly useful in applications needing parallelism or handling multiple tasks at once.)\n",
